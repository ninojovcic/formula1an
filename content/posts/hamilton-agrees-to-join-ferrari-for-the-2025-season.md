Insider information suggests that **the Formula 1 deal bringing Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari for the 2025 season has been finalized.** We anticipate his placement alongside **Charles Leclerc**, replacing **Carlos Sainz** at **Maranello**, with an official confirmation expected in the coming days.

This imminent move marks the conclusion of an unparalleled partnership between **Hamilton and Mercedes**. The 2024 season will signify Hamilton's *12th year with AMG Mercedes F1*, and throughout his entire 17-season F1 career, he has exclusively been powered by Mercedes.

Despite Hamilton's recent contract extension with Mercedes for two years, it appears that **the second year was an optional clause on his part**. This flexibility enables him to embrace the offer from **John Elkann**, Ferrari's corporate chief.

Hamilton had previously speculated that a stint with Ferrari would be a fitting conclusion to his career, but he had later expressed the expectation of remaining with Mercedes until retirement.

**Carlos Sainz's** contract with **Ferrari** is set to expire *at the end of this year*, concluding his fourth season with the team. During his tenure, Sainz has achieved two Grand Prix victories and proven to be an effective teammate to **Leclerc**, whose contract was recently extended for several years.

The prospect of a **Hamilton-Leclerc** pairing at **Ferrari** adds excitement to Formula 1, especially after an off-season where no driver changed teams. However, this move poses a bold challenge for Hamilton in competitive terms, given uncertainties about **Ferrari's ability to rival Red Bull**. Additionally, being directly measured against the notably fast Leclerc, who is routinely regarded as one of **the sport's quickest drivers over a single lap**, adds an intriguing dimension to this decision at the age of 40.
