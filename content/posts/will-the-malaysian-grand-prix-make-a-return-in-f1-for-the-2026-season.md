**The Sepang International Circuit** in **Malaysia** hosted its first Formula 1 race in 1999. Known for its unique layout and challenging turns, it became a staple on the F1 calendar. Sepang has seen memorable moments, including **Michael Schumacher's** dominant wins. However, financial issues led to its **removal from the F1 calendar after the 2017 season.**

But now seven years later, the fan-favorite track is rumored to return in the near future. According to the internal sources by a Malaysian news website *Careta.my*, **Sepang is set to host F1 races in 2026.** That comes simultaneously with the introduction of new rules that will come into force in the same year.

The Sepang International Circuit has sealed itâ€™s 3 year naming rights agreement with **Petronas**, which according to mulitple sources plays a big role in financial support for its return. The circuit was originally named the Sepang International Circuit when it opened in 1999. Petronas signed a significant sponsorship deal with the circuit, leading to the name change to **"Sepang International Circuit, sponsored by Petronas."** According to si.com, the circuit still being under the Petronas name gives high hopes for the return of F1 onto the track, but also gives reeasurance for the Malaysian motorsports scene and local industries connected to the sport.

# The Sepang Circuit at the very beginning

The inaugural F1 Grand Prix in the country took place on **October 17, 1999**, featuring **56 laps on the 5.542km (3.444-mile)** circuit amid cloudy and hot conditions. This marked the comeback of Ferrari's **Michael Schumacher** after a leg injury at **Silverstone**.

Securing pole position in qualifying, Schumacher, acknowledging he was out of the championship contention, strategically allowed teammate **Eddie Irvine** to overtake and clinch the victory. Irvine's win placed him four points ahead in the championship, but **Mika Hakkinen** claimed the title with a victory in **Japan** two weeks later.

Since Irvine's triumph, various drivers have celebrated victories in Sepang, including Michael Schumacher (three times), his brother **Ralf**, **Kimi Raikkonen** (twice), **Fernando Alonso** (three wins), **Giancarlo Fisichella**, **Jenson Button**, **Lewis Hamilton**, and **Daniel Ricciardo**.

The most accomplished F1 driver in Malaysia is **Sebastian Vettel**, securing victories in *2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015*. **Ferrari** stands as the most successful team with a total of seven victories.
