![McLaren, Aston Martin and Mercedes cars (Credits: F1)](https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1694507519/fom-website/2023/Miscellaneous/mclaren-aston-martin-mercedes-2023.png.transform/9col/image.png)

The Mercedes team made a late decision to switch their design concept from their flawed 2022 design and apply the Red Bull concept. That mistake becomes more obvious, when the likes of Aston Martin and McLaren, both of whom their engines are supplied by Mercedes, are benefiting hugely from accepting the Red Bull’s design.

Aston Martin has shown great signs of improvement in the first half of the season, while the McLaren team has moved up significantly in the second half. Both of the teams have moved towards the Red Bull concept, with McLaren even coming close to challenging the Red Bull in Brazil.

The updates brought to the McLaren midway through the season, have established Lando Norris as Max Verstappen’s biggest competitor over the second half of the season.

# Why is Mercedes being outperformed by its own customers?

Naomi Schiff told the Sky Sports F1 Podcast: « You've got to ask how has a team like McLaren, who from at least the power unit perspective is a customer team of Mercedes, how have they so dramatically been able to turn it around? How were Aston at the beginning of the season, so dramatically able to turn it around and why is a team like Mercedes still struggling? »

« Obviously, they didn't bite the bullet at the beginning of the year or during the winter period last year to completely change their concept, and I think there are some major regrets about that because they could be much further forward today. »

« But when you're essentially working on a mechanical base that is faulty and you're just trying to make the best of a situation, it's not going to be great. »

« At the end of the day, they're a team who's won multiple world championships. They know how to build a car. »

« I have some faith that they will be able over this winter to turn their situation around. But then again, as I say, Red Bull is so far up the road and they're doing the same thing over the winter period. »

« So it's always going to be a question mark to see where they end up next year. »

# Silver lining for the Mercedes team

The race to development of the 2026 engines is getting more competitive as each day passes. According to the sources, Mercedes is currently the furthest one in the development. They are so further ahead, that they are apparently ready to test their power units on the test bench.
