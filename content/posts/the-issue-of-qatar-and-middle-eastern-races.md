# The Qatar aftermath

A single Formula 1 driver on average loses around 2-3 kg a race. The weight loss mostly consists of water loss due to high physical demands of driving at astonishing speeds and high G-force intensities. In hotter conditions the effect intensifies.

The temperatures in Lusail soared to exceed over 50 degrees Celsius outside, but also inside the drivers cockpits for up to 57 laps, lasting for *1 hour and 28 minutes*.

Many drivers were reporting feeling sick and close to passing out inside the car. The Alpineâ€™s driver **Esteban Ocon** vomitted inside his helmet at the very start of the race while the Williams driver **Alex Albon** was treated for acute heat exposure at the on-track medical centre. **Logan Sargeant** was forced to retire after driving 41 laps after giving his best to battle the illness during the Qatar Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver **Lando Norris** and the london-born **George Russel** reported in one of their post-race interviews that up to *50 per cent* of the grid had been affected by the extreme heat in Lusail.

The most visible effect was unfortunately on the Aston Martin driver **Lance Stroll**. He reportedly said he was passing in and out at the high speed corners during the race due to extreme heat and exhaustion. He was later seen stumbling towards an on-site ambulance after the race.
