According to [Jalopnik](https://jalopnik.com/i-hope-it-bankrupts-them-las-vegas-residents-enraged-a-1851009102) the people of Las Vegas are frustrated and furious at the organizers of the race in Las Vegas.

The residents and workers in Las Vegas said the construction of the Las Vegas GP ended their lives as they knew them. They are frustrated by the lack of information and coordination with everyone, except the promoters of the race.

Residents aren't the only ones affected by the construction and preparations for the race. The tourists are frustrated due to "nightmare" traffic and numerous restrictions on the Strip, making it untravelable. The best pedestrian bridge in town is covered, but many streets are closed down or diverted due to the race. Parts of the sidewalk from the Vdara to the Venetian are closed, and people are crammed onto one side of the sidewalk.

According to the residents, a lot of money was invested into making the Strip road smooth and ready for the race, but the surrounding roads are terrible.
