![Felipe Massa expects support from his former team Ferrari](https://e1.365dm.com/13/08/768x432/formula-1-grand-prix-united-states-austin-texas-stefano-domenicali-felipe-massa_2994612.jpg?20130828154238)

Felipe Massa has said, that he hopes and expects support from Ferrari on his 2008 on-going legal action for the World Championship title.

Massa believes he can overturn the result of the title loss in 2008, when he lost the title to Lewis Hamilton by one point. Then Formula 1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone suggested he knew about Singapore Grand Prix being fixed by Renault during the season, but he decided not to take any action despite the information he had.

The 11-time Grand Prix winner is not interested in any kind of financial settlement. The Brazilianâ€™s legal team is awaiting documents from the FIA and F1 with the deadline being extended to November 15th.

Massas then team Ferrari has been quiet so far about the case, as well as Hamilton who is not taking particular interest in the case. Massa believes the Ferrari team will support his battle, as the team also lost a championship that year.

"I am still expecting to be together and have support, because at the end, we lost the championship together,"

"So I definitely expect it to be on my side, because we lost the championship together through the manipulation that happened.

"Anytime that you hear about Toto Wolff talking about 2021, he is the most supportive person, so with that, I cannot really believe that Ferrari won't be on that situation with me.

"For the moment, they are quiet, but I really believe they will be on my side, and I really hope that is the case because that is the correct thing for what happened to us.

"What happened to me, happened to Ferrari as well."
