The FIA and Formula 1 are working under high pressure to produce the next generation of cars for the 2026 season. Collected from information inside the paddocks and planned changes, here are the first 3D renders of the 2026 Formula 1 cars.

It has been known for some time now that the FIA wants to turn more towards the electric model of cars, which the 2026 next generation of cars will be leaning towards. The next generation of cars will derive 50 percent of their energy from electric power. The chassis fraction is forced to undergo a dramatic conversion, and the battery will contribute 475 HP to the system's performance. The cars are predicted to be smaller, lighter, and more efficient at using electric power from their batteries.

#### Here are some general bullet points about the next generation of Formula 1 cars:

- The width is reduced from 200 cm to 190 cm.
- Wheelbase is reduced from 360 to 340 cm.
- Rim size is shrinking from 18 to 16 inches (45 to 40 cm).
- Active aero to reduce drag on straights
- DRS on the front and rear wings is to be considered.
- Minimal weight should decrease by 20 kg.
- On average, the new generation of cars shouldn't be more than a second behind the current generation of cars.
- You can read more details about these changes below.

# Active front and rear wing
The diffuser should be restricted at height. The halo and the cockpit are designed to be slimmer and thus have little front surface in the wind. The baffles introduced in 2022 on the front axle are expected to cover the wheels even more strongly to reduce air turbulence.

Active aerodynamics will further reduce the drag on the straight. At least one DRS effect on the front wing and on the rear wing is intended. The rear wing gets four elements instead of two: one main sheet and three flaps. There are also considerations for making the Beam Wing or the Diffusorkante movable.

According to initial plans, the minimum weight should be reduced by 20 kilograms. Now the predictions are to reduce the weight from 25 to as much as 30 kilograms. The wheelbase is shortened from 360 to 340 centimeters. Smaller cars automatically mean less mass.

# "Inwash" system
The return to gas springs has been discussed, making the suspension layouts much simpler and therefore contributing to the weight loss of the next generation of cars. The FIA sees this as a new potential battlefield for the teams.

However, the aerodynamic concept is to be changed completely as well. The air is to be kept inside the "inwash" system instead of "outwash" and "downwash". The first sketch shows that even the end plates of the front wing are so angled that they lead the air inside the wheels.

Vertical baffles are provided in front of the side boxes and in front of the rear wheels on the underbody, with which the flow is also directed inward. They are intended to help better seal the critical gap between the rear tire and diffuser.

# Cars are not much slower.
In order to compensate for the loss of downforce due to a less sharp increase in the diffuser at the rear, the Venturi channels are allowed to start higher at the front input. Under the car, two additional fins can be attached to the left and right before the rise of the diffuser to direct the current more inward.

According to measurements by the FIA technicians, these measures are to make driving afterwards much easier than the 2022 concept. The turbulence that a car radiates to the rear with the Inwash principle is reduced. The slipstream effect should also become bigger. This speaks for more overtaking.

Fears that the cars could slow down by three to four seconds and only sail on straight lines are premature. The recent simulations only yielded a slight increase in lap times. This will depend heavily on whether a route is more power-limited or grip-limited. On average, it should not be more than a second.

# What does the future look like?
These are definitely changes in the right direction. The current generation of cars weighs close to 800 kilograms, which can make them very slow. The weight reduction and better aerodynamic regulations to increase the effect of DRS are things that the drivers have been requesting for some time now.

The current situation is that for certain cars, it is very hard to do overtakes safely, which was the whole point of implementing DRS in the first place. Shrinking the cars in width and length is another great change since the current generation is, according to the drivers, very hard to drive in the narrow street races such as in Azerbaijan and Monaco.

All in all, these are some great changes so far, and I'm sure more are to come as we get closer and closer to the 2026 regulation changes.
