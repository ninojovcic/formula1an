The Sprint format has been here for a few seasons. Changes were made to the format in 2023, but the opinions have mostly stayed the same. Drivers and fans have shown their dissatisfaction with the Sprint format, most notably Max Verstappen, who has been very vocal recently on this topic. Ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen told the media that the Sprint should just be scrapped.


"We should just get rid of the Sprint weekend, and then everyone can just set up their cars normally.

“Why do we need to try and invent something? I think our product works if you just make sure that the cars are competitive and the rules will stay the same for a long time,” said Verstappen.

"Why are we always inventing new things? It almost sounds out of like craziness that ‘oh, we need to come up with something’.

“In football, they don't change the rules or in other sports. It's been like that for 100 years.

“Why do we suddenly need to come up with other things to try and make it entertaining?

“I think if you have a good race on your hands with cars being close to each other, then you don't need a sprint format or weekend.”

Apart from the criticism, a majority of the drivers said they don't prefer the Sprint weekend, but that they do enjoy the one free practice session during the Sprint weekends.
Charles Leclerc and other drivers have expressed that they like only having one free practice session; having only one session to set up the car makes that session much more important than usual.


So what are the possible solutions to fixing the Sprint format other than, as Max said, completely scrapping it?


# 1. Reversing the starting grid
One of the possible solutions being thrown around a lot is the idea of reversing the starting grid for the sprint race. Drivers once again have mixed opinions on this solution as well. Few have said that they don't mind, but the idea of reversing the grid defeats the purpose of qualifying for the Sprint, which, quite frankly, makes sense. Qualifying for the Sprint wouldn't make any sense at all if the reward for driving the fastest lap is being last on the grid. But the reverse grid would fix a different problem. Valtteri Bottas told the media at one of the press conferences that the Sprint races don't really serve a purpose for the teams that can't battle for the top eight spots. Currently, the Sprint race only awards points to the top eight finishers, which for teams at the bottom of the constructors championship is an impossible task.

# 2. One-lap qualifying

Another solution that's been brought up is for the one-lap qualifying format to make a comeback in the Sprint format. The one-lap qualifying could potentially make the final grid more interesting, but it's important to remember why the one-lap qualifying was replaced by the current format. Track evolution has a massive impact on qualifying laps, where even a thousandth of a second matters. Because of track evolution, but also the weather changes, at least one of the drivers would always be at a disadvantage due to the running order.


# 3. One driver per team

An interesting solution that would most definitely make the Sprint race spicy would be to bring in the one driver per team rule. Teams would have to choose which one of their drivers they would want to compete in the sprint format for that weekend. That could bring some interesting new strategies, not only on the grid but inside the teams themselves. The problem with this solution would be the uneven use of components inside the cars. The FIA has many strict rules regarding the usage of each and every component in cars, but with some changes, I don't see why something like this couldn't be implemented.
