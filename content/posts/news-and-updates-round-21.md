## Logan Sargeant’s seat is safe for 2024
Yes, it’s safe. Or is it? Well, not exactly. As of now, I quote, “all indications suggest” that Sargeant will continue his 2024 season with Williams. Nothing has been officially confirmed or signed yet, but I think it’s safe to assume it’s true. Of course, it’s not all green because the pressure will be a lot higher in the 2024 season for him to prove himself and keep the seat longer. Honestly, I am not surprised. For reasons unknown to me, people like to give Sargeant a hard time. People like to forget that Sargeant is a rookie after all, but I don’t think he’s been doing as badly. He struggles mostly in qualifying, which he admits he needs to work on (also one of the things I like about him—he takes accountability and wants to improve), but his race pace has been, in my opinion, one of the top 5 on the grid in these past few races. He seems to really excel on Sundays, and I think if he puts together a good qualifying session and does his usual on Sunday, he could do results almost up to par with Albon.

## Alonso/Red Bull/Aston Martin love triangle
There's not much to say about this whole mess. Would I like to see it happen? Absolutely. Another 21/22 transfer storm, I’m sure, is something we all secretly hope for. Will it actually happen? No one knows. Seriously, I’m not even sure if Fernando knows what he wants to do. He’s been threatening “harsh consequences” to anyone commenting on this rumor, but I don’t buy it. I mean, it’s Fernando, and it wouldn’t surprise me even slightly if he created (another) storm. I myself am not even sure how these rumors started or where they originated. As far as I know, Albert Fabrega did his little high schooler “I know a secret, but I can’t tell you, but I’ll still talk about it all the time” schenanigans (which he did apologize for later on, respect for that on his part), and the Reddit/Twitter army took the flag and ran with it. In other words, the rumor is literally made up.

## São Paulo GP stays until 2030
Great news. I love the track. I love the people and the country. I hope we don’t get another storm like we did in the future. Here’s a little video of the grandstand roof flying!

## São Paulo Sprint… Great!
Straight forward I’m not the biggest fan of the Sprint formats, for obvious reasons. With that being said, this was one of the sprints that I absolutely loved. Not sure who to give credit to here, but I think this was a great combination of the drivers being open to battling and clean overtakes, as well as the São Paulo track being beautifully designed. The turn 1 overtake potential on the outside and the inside, transitioning into turn 4 straight to give the overtaken driver a chance to get back, is simply amazing. Max and Lando were the ones that stood out the most here. Max was in a league of his own, per usual, but Lando stepped up and was consistent at keeping up with Max. The Aston Martins had decent potential but didn’t have much time to see it through. The Ferrari’s were decent at the start, but they seem to fall off hard after 12–15 laps on softs (my best guess is due to their heavy tyre wear). Sainz barely held onto that 8th place, finishing 0.3s in front of Dani, and Charles went in front of Lewis, but that was more due to the Merc’s rear tyres being completely gone at the end of the sprint. I’m writing this right after the Sprint Race, and so far, I feel like the Astons will give a good battle tomorrow, as well as the McLarens, per usual. I’m a bit afraid for the Ferrari’s because of their terrible degradation, but with good tyre management, they could be looking at a P4 or P5 finish at best, unfortunately. I think the Mercs will be competitive tomorrow as well. Today's sprint doesn’t really reflect their race pace, which has been great at past races. So my predictions are:

**P1 VER, P2 NOR, P3 HAM, P4 LEC, P5 ALO**

## The Race
Same as the sprint race. Lando showed up and kept up pretty well, even battling with Max in the first stint. Aston Martin’s showed really good pace, reminding me of the pace they had back in Montrreal. Mercedes were a surprise, but a bad one. So surprised with their terrible pace, the sprint showed them falling off badly after 15 laps on the softs, but I expected them to do better on mediums, on which they did even worse than the softs (insert Toto throwing his headset). Charles is getting extremely unlucky, becoming his trademark at this point. He's pretty sure he’s cursed. Pretty bummed for Riccardo and Piastri, who both had good pace, but obviously that +1 lap ruined their race. Overall, the remaining Ferraris had decent pace, but at this race, they were the 4th fastest team, which is still pretty bad for their standards.
