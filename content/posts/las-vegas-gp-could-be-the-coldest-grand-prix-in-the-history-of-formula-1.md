According to sources, as of right now it is predicted that the temperatures for the Las Vegas Grand Prix could be as low as 4 celsius degrees or 39 fahrenheit.

The current record holder for the coldest Grand Prix in the history of Formula 1 is the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix, where the temperatures reached as low as 5 celsius degrees or 41 fahrenheit. The Grand Prix was held in Montreal. It was the 16th and final race of the 1978 season. That race was the first ever win for the Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve.

The concern comes from the fact that there are no « proper » corners at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Corners are there to put the temperature in the tyres while the straights usually are there to cool the tyres down. The combination of record breaking low temperatures and tyre cooling straights could possibly lead to a huge mess of a race.

If the weather forecast turns out to be true, the teams could be facing many setup and strategy changes that could involve many safety cars and red flags. It will be interesting to see what the teams will come up with in that scenario and who will come out on top.
