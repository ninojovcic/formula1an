Following the US GP incident, in which the Scuderia Ferrari and AMG Mercedes drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewish Hamilton were disqualified. Lando Norris has taken a stand and says that he wished more cars were inspected.

## "I guess you're always a little bit surprised...I would have loved if they checked more cars."

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc were disqualified after the concluded US Grand Prix hosted in Austin, Texas last Sunday. The FIA said they randomly selected cars for plank inspection. The Monegasque driver and the British driver exceeded the 1 mm rule of the FIA and were therefore disqualified and their positions were taken away.

## "They checked my car first."
