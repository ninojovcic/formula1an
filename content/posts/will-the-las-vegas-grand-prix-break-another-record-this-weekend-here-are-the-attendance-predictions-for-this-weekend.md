The demand for the Las Vegas GP is expected to be huge and the Las Vegas GP could potentialy be [breaking another record this weekend](https://formula1an.com/posts/las-vegas-gp-could-be-the-coldest-grand-prix-in-the-history-of-formula-1/), but not in a good way. Exactly how many seats were available to the public was unknown, until now. People on social media were complaining that they weren't able to get the tickets due to high demand. The waiting times for the online box office to buy the tickets were very long.

According to [*The Las Vegas Review Journal*](https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/motor-sports/formula-1/let-the-racing-begin-inaugural-f1-events-start-wednesday-night-2937145/?utm_campaign=widget&utm_medium=topnews&utm_source=homepage&utm_term=Let%20the%20racing%20begin%21%20Inaugural%20F1%20events%20start%20Wednesday%20night) **105,000 people are expected to be in the city for the event.** Approximently twenty to thirty thousand fans are predicted to have a ticket for one of the Grandstands around the track.

# The least attended race of the 2023 season
If these numbers turn out to be true, the race that was supposed to be the most exciting and attended spectacle of the season will be the **least attended** race of the season. Comparing it to the Austin Grand Prix attendance numbers it records 440,000 attendees, which is 335,000 more than the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Las Vegas Review Journal doesn't include how many fans will be watching the race from special places in hotels or VIP boxes, but given the extremely high prices for such accomodations, those seats won't be raising the attendance by much. A possible reason for such underwelming numbers could be the very expensive hotel and accomodation costs. A night during the Las Vegas race weekend, can cost up to $1,000 which for the average fans could present a big expense.

Comparing these numbers to the 2022 F1 Grand Prix attendance, the Las Vegas Grand Prix would rank just above the Bahrain Grand Prix which ranked last at 98,000 attendees.

# Latest start time in the history of Formula 1

Another record that the Las Vegas Grand Prix will be breaking is the record for the latest start time in F1 history. The main event will start on the 18th November (Saturday) at 22:00 aka 10 p.m. These start times are chosen this way to suit the as many stakeholders and fans as possible, but also because the city of Las Vegas thrives during night time.

The race will start in the early to mid-morning hours in the UK and most of Europe and mid to late morning hours in Africa. In Asia and Australia, the race start will be in the afternoon and evening hours.  These times are in close range to the start times of the Australian and Japanese Grands Prix.

# Coldest race in the history of Formula 1

Another record the Las Vegas Grand Prix could potentially set is the record for the coldest Grand Prix in the history of Formula 1. According to sources, as of right now it is predicted that the temperatures for the Las Vegas Grand Prix could be as low as 4 celsius degrees or 39 fahrenheit.

The current record holder for the coldest Grand Prix in the history of Formula 1 is the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix, where the temperatures reached as low as 5 celsius degrees or 41 fahrenheit.
