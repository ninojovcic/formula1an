## Q1
After a messy Q1 the 5 slowest drivers were: Esteban Ocon, Lando Norris, Lance Stroll, Logan Sargeant and Kevin Magnussen. Lando’s strategy turned against him when the McLaren’s decided to put up their first lap times late into the session. Logan Seargent and Esteban Ocon didn’t make the Q2 after Fernando Alonso spun out in sector 1 near the end of the session.

## Q2
Q2 was the end for Alexander Albon, Pierre Gasley, Fernando Alonso, Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda.
Alex Albon time was deleted after putting up a good lap to proceed into Q3 for exceeding track limits at turn 2.
Yuki Tsunoda will be starting from the pitbox due to changes of the cars power unit and the gearbox.

## Q3
Ferraris showed a rather pale pace in Q1 and Q2, but managed to pull out some amazing pace in Q3, for the lack of better words they magically pulled out amazing lap times and both cars qualified first and second. Another honorable mention is Daniel Riccardo who showed amazing pace all throughout the qualifying and qualified 4th behind Max Verstappen.

Additionally, Max Verstappen, George Russel and Fernando Alonso will be investigated after the qualification for potentially impeding at the pit exit. The potential penalty is a 3 place drop on the Sundays race.

No further investigation regarding VER, RUS and ALO pit lane exit impeding.
Logan Sargeant received a 10 place grid drop and penalty points for overtaking under yellow flag. The Williams team has been fined with 20 000€ fine which of 10 000€ is suspended for 12 months because of leaving equipment in the pit that Yuki Tsunoda hit.
