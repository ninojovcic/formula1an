![Ferrari drivers are doing Pirelli tyre tests in Barcelona](/ferrari-sf-24.jpeg)

**Carlos Sainz** and **Charles Leclerc** have started their 2024 season with a Pirelli tyre test in **Barcelona**.

The Italian tyre manufacturer is working along side F1 teams to develope new tyre sets for the **2025 season**. Their goal is to reduce overheating for the last year of 18-inch tyre regulations.

Formula 1 is intending to move from 18-inch tyres to 16-inch tyres following the 2026 season to make the single-seaters as fast and as light as possible.

The Spaniard drove the **SF-24** for the first time in Barcelona today which was his first of the two days of Pirelli testing. Afternoon was all reserved for the number 16 driver **Charles Leclerc**. The Monegasque driver continued the testing of the slick tyres since the testing of the new wets has been cancelled. 

# Pirelli Wet Tyre Tests Delayed

Spain is currently undergoing a severe drought and the authorities have decided that it is necessary to ration water so the idea of wetting the track was out of question as it has been previously done for these tests.

# SF-75

Ferrari took advantage of the Pirelli tests to run their SF-75 which will be driven by the Scuderias newest signings **Oliver Bearman** and **Arthur Leclerc**. Leclerc joined Ferraris' driver development and simulation team, while Bearman on the other hand joined as the num. 1 reserve driver for C. Leclerc and Sainz.
