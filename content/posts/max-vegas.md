"We're going to Vegas, baby!" something you will most likely never hear Max Verstappen say. The drivers attended the Las Vegas opening ceremony. They were lifted up on huge platforms to wave at the fans and the Las Vegas crowd on the start/finish line.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix is expected to be the biggest spectacle and sporting event of the year. Huge investments have been made into the track, as well as organizing the event and the show around the race.

While many of the drivers are evoking the Sin City show, numerous Elvis impersonators, and glitz and glam everywhere you look, Max Verstappen is definitely not one of those drivers.

Max Verstappen has expressed his discomfort and dissatisfaction with the Las Vegas Grand Prix in many ways. He said he has "zero interest" in everything that's going on behind the scenes. He told The Race: "I don’t like all the things around it. I’m looking forward to trying to do the best I can, but I’m not looking forward to this."

Max continued: "For me, you can all skip these kinds of things. It’s just standing up there; you look like a clown.” And when asked about the show vs. sport balance, he said, “99% show, 1% sporting event."

"Not a lot of emotions, to be honest. I just want to always focus on the performance side of things; I don’t like all the things around it anyway. I know, of course, that in some places they are part of it, but let’s say it’s not in my interest."

But the spectacle is not the only thing Max Verstappen isn't fond of at the Las Vegas GP.

Max Verstappen said that he does not find the Las Vegas GP layout interesting at all.

"It’s just not many corners, to be honest."

"It also will depend probably a bit on how grippy it is. It doesn't look like it has a lot of grip, but we’ll go with the flow."

"I don’t think it’s that exciting; that’s the only thing. But I think, naturally, for me, a street circuit is not very exciting, especially with these new cars. They’re just too heavy. Especially then, when you have low grip, that doesn’t help."

"Of course the scenery will look great driving through the Strip. But the layout itself is not the most exciting."

"An F1 car’s a lot more fun with a lot of high-speed corners, and I think around there there are not that many high-speed corners."
