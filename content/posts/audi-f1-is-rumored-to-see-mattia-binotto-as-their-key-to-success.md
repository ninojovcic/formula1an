It is said that the Audi F1 team is interested in hiring Mattia Binotto. Apparently they see Binotto as the « key to their success » in their F1 entry in 2026. The former Ferrari team leader is one of the names on their shortlist of candidates.

The race to development of the 2026 engines is getting more competitive as each day passes. According to the sources, Mercedes is currently the furthest one in the development. They are so further ahead, that they are apparently ready to test their power units on the test bench. According to the Italian media, Audi seems to be behind in this development.

According to the sources, Audi is still looking for more engineers. Their search has been more difficult than expected for the German manufacturer than initially planned. Mattia Binotto is one of the names on their shortlist. Binotto was the former team leader for Ferrari last season, moving from the role of head of engine department. It is rumoured that it is exactly what Audi is looking for.
