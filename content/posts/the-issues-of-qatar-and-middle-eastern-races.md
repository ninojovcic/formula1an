# The Qatar aftermath

A single Formula 1 driver on average loses around 2-3 kg/4-6 lbs a race. The weight loss mostly consists of water loss due to the high physical demands of driving at astonishing speeds and high G-force intensities. In hotter conditions, the effect intensifies.

The temperatures in Lusail soared to exceed over 50 degrees Celsius outside, but also inside the drivers cockpits for up to 57 laps, lasting for *1 hour and 28 minutes*.

Many drivers were reporting feeling sick and close to passing out inside the car. The Alpine’s driver **Esteban Ocon** vomitted inside his helmet at the very start of the race while the Williams driver **Alex Albon** was treated for acute heat exposure at the on-track medical center. **Logan Sargeant** was forced to retire after driving 41 laps after giving his best to battle the illness during the Qatar Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver **Lando Norris** and the London-born **George Russell** reported in one of their post-race interviews that up to *50 percent* of the grid had been affected by the extreme heat in Lusail.

The most visible effect was unfortunately on the Aston Martin driver's **Lance Stroll**. He reportedly said he was passing in and out at the high-speed corners during the race due to extreme heat and exhaustion. He was later seen stumbling towards an on-site ambulance after the race.

On the other hand, **Lewis Hamilton** said that this is exactly what the drivers should be going through. Hamilton says that they are competing in an extreme sport and therefore they should be physically ready for these conditions. Hamilton said this after ending his Qatar Grand Prix on the opening lap of the race after colliding with his Mercedes teammate George Russell in turn 1.

# Is it all worth it?

An incident like this should bring more attention, but unfortunately, a full month later, it is forgotten. Articles written, questions asked, and a week later, onto the next race. Qatar is an infamous country known for, you guessed it, **sports washing**.

Most famously, Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatar and Formula 1 came to an agreement to extend the contract for 10 more years, paying Formula 1 an astonishing **$55 million per year**. Qatar Airways also happens to be replacing Emirates as the Formula 1 sponsor in a deal worth **$300 million**. Now that’s what we like to call some good old sports washing.

So at what cost does that all come to the fans and the drivers? At the cost of risking their own lives and the lives of other drivers. The public had a bad outlook on **Logan Sargeant** for his retirement in the race, but the reality is that he was the only responsible driver on the grid that day. Many drivers reported *almost* passing out in high-speed corners and many other side effects caused by the extreme heat, e.g., blurred vision. Those factors alone are a recipe for disaster. It feels like pure luck that no serious crashes or injuries occurred that day.

# Should the Qatar GP have its place in the Formula 1 calendar?

This opens up a whole new topic of disscusion, a disscusion bigger than just Formula 1 as a sport. A topic on which a big majority of the public agrees on, but has no effect on. Unfortunately, as of now the Qatar race and similar middle eastern races are here to stay. A solution or rather a band-aid at the very least is to do a better job at executing these races and protect the drivers on the grid. They should not be held at a time of the year when the heat and the weather don't allow the drivers to execute a safe race and avoid risking their own lives and lives of their fellow drivers on the track.
