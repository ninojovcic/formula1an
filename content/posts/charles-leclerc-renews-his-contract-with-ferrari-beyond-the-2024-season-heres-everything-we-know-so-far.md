Fred Vasseur, the Ferrari principal said:
"Charles’ bond to the Scuderia goes beyond that of just a driver and a team, as he has been part of the Ferrari family for eight years now... We are determined to give Charles a winning car and I know that his determination and commitment are elements that can make the difference in helping us reach our goals"

The exact details of the contract aren't publicly known as of writting this article, but there have been rumors from credible sources floating around social media.

"Obviously I want to renew and I'd like to renew for more than one year, not just two," the 29-year-old Spaniard said of his desire to secure a long-term deal. "I feel perfectly valued by Fred and by the whole Ferrari family in general, I feel loved.

"Therefore, I will renew if I feel that way and I feel that I am valued. I am convinced that if we both want to, we will reach an agreement on a duration that I am happy with."

It has been publicly said in the past couple of days that the Spaniard and the Italian team aren't able to come to an agreement about his contract extension and that the negotiations are still under way.
