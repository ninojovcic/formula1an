Mercedes has only won one race since November 2021. But Toto Wolff ensures that Lewis Hamilton and George Russel will have a competitive car in the 2024 season. The W15 will finally move towards the Red Bull design concept, a concept that made them so dominant in 2022 and 2023.

Damon Hill doubts their promises. Hills says that he hopes the aerodynamics department will be successful in their design, but he isn’t convinced.

« What worries me is that, as has happened for a long time, Mercedes' dominance was really due to its power unit. They had the best power unit for a long time. And the aerodynamics were always slightly different from Red Bull's. And if you remember, towards the end of the previous Formula 1 regulation, they persisted with their relatively flat-looking rake in the car. On the other hand, Red Bull had an absolutely huge rake. » Hill told the F1 podcast of Sky Sports.

« They led the way and everyone started following Red Bull with this very high rake. It looked like a rat running along the car. It had a very high back. »

« But Mercedes stuck persistently or doggedly with their with their other… they looked like they were running a different aero concept on their car in the previous regulations, and then along come a new set of regulations… »

« What I'm saying is, is the Mercedes aero department missing a trick here? »

# Mercedes cannot afford another year without a fight for a title

According to Damon Hill, the Mercedes aerodynamics department lost several people from their team. They went to other teams and they were rehired, but Mercedes cannot afford another year without a fight for the world title.

Hill’s comments come the week after Mike Elliot left his position as the Mercedes chief technical officer, after he had been moved earlier on from the role of technical director.

Another issue raising is that of Lewis Hamilton. The 7 times world champion is hungry for a championship competitive car. It is certain that he will not be satisfied spending his possibly last years in Formula 1 with a non-competitive car. Those doubts were addressed when Lewis Hamilton and George Russel both signed an extension this year to stay with Mercedes until 2025. With new regulations coming, his position in Mercedes won’t be as solid as of right now.
